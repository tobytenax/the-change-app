Key Features

    Dual-Currency System: A unique token economy (Acents & Dcents) that rewards both competence and participation.

    Competence Verification: Users must pass quizzes to vote directly on proposals, ensuring informed decision-making.

    Direct Democracy & Delegation: Participate by voting directly or by delegating your vote to a trusted expert.

Understanding the Dual-Currency System

The Change App uses two types of tokens: Acents and Dcents.
Acents (Ⓐ)

Earned through demonstrating competence:

    Passing quizzes

    Making competent comments

    Having your comments integrated into a proposal

Used for:

    Creating proposals (costs 5 Acents)

    Making competent comments (free)

Dcents (Ⓓ)

Earned through participation:

    Delegating your vote

    Receiving delegated votes

    Voting on comments

    Receiving upvotes on comments

Used for:

    Making non-competent comments (costs 3 Dcents)

    Other internal platform activities

    The "alchemical space" is the comment section, where Dcents can be converted to Acents when non-competent comments receive enough upvotes to be integrated into proposals.

Competence Verification through Quizzes

To vote directly on proposals, you must demonstrate competence by passing a quiz related to the proposal's topic. Each proposal has an associated quiz that tests your knowledge.

Passing the quiz:

    Allows you to vote directly on the proposal.

    Earns you 1 Acent.

    Enables you to make competent comments for free.

    Gives your vote more weight in the system.

If you don't pass the quiz, you can:

    Delegate your vote to someone who has passed (earning 1 Dcent).

    Make non-competent comments (costs 3 Dcents).

    Retake the quiz after learning more about the topic.

This system ensures that decisions are made by those who understand the issues, while still allowing everyone to participate.
Voting and Delegation

The Change App offers two ways to participate in voting: direct voting and delegation.
Direct Voting

If you pass the competence quiz:

    You can vote directly (Yes/No) on proposals.

    You earn 1 Acent for voting.

    You earn additional Acents for each delegated vote you represent.

Delegation

If you don't pass the quiz:

    You can delegate your vote to a user who has passed the quiz.

    You earn 1 Dcent for delegating.

    The delegatee earns 1 Acent when they vote with your delegation.

Delegation Rules:

    You can revoke a delegation at any time (forfeiting the Dcent earned).

    If you later pass the quiz and vote yourself, you regain the Dcent plus earn an Acent.

    Redelegation to another user is restricted financially for one year.

The Comment System and Integration

Comments are the "alchemical space" where Dcents can be transformed into Acents through community recognition.
Competent Comments

(Requires passing the quiz)

    Cost: Free

    Your comments are marked as "Competent".

    You earn 1 Acent for each upvote received.

Non-Competent Comments

(If you have not passed the quiz)

    Cost: 3 Dcents

    You earn 1 Dcent for each upvote received.

    If your comment receives enough upvotes, it can be integrated.

Comment Integration

Integration is the process of officially adding a comment's text to the proposal. This happens in two ways:

    Manual: The proposal author can integrate any comment.

    Automatic: Comments with upvotes exceeding 50% of the proposal's total votes are automatically integrated.

    When a non-competent comment is integrated, the Dcents earned from upvotes are converted to Acents, rewarding valuable contributions regardless of initial quiz status.
